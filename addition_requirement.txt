For our additional requirement we made three improvements.

(1) We added color to improve the asthetic of the visualization.

(2) We drew axes on our bar and line graphs, to make them
	more informative. 

(3) We added a suggestion bar to the top of the visualization The 
    purpose of this bar is to help users understand what each different 
    visualization shows. For example, the suggestion bar when the 
    bar chart is shown reads "Try 'Line' for trends and 'Pie' for 
    parts of a whole!". When the pie chart is shown the suggestion
    is "Try 'Bar' to compare Y values!". And finally, when the line
    chart is shown the suggestion is "Try 'Bar' to compare Y values!". 
    Our hope with these suggestions is that users will understand that
    a line chart is best for understanding trends in the data, a bar 
    chart is best for comparing y-values in the data, and a pie
    chart is best for comparing each y-value as a part of the whole
    data set.
